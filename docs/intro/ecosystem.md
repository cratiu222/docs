## Shell: The Multifunctional dApp

A primary application within the HAQQ Network is "shell" a decentralized application (dApp) designed to augment user experience within this network. Shell plays a multifaceted role by enabling users to monitor their balances, stake their coins, and engage in network governance by voting for proposals. With its intuitive and user-friendly interface, Shell significantly enhances network efficiency and user engagement.

## The Sharia Oracle: A Unique Vetting Mechanism

In the dynamic and evolving ecosystem of the HAQQ Network, all future developments and additions are subject to the approval of the Sharia Board, using a unique vetting mechanism called the Sharia Oracle. This ensures that any changes or additions to the HAQQ Network align with Sharia law, maintaining the network's integrity under Islamic law and fostering trust and reassurance for its users.

## Transparency in dApp Integrations

Moreover, the HAQQ Network maintains complete transparency about the status of various dApp integrations within its ecosystem. Users can find a comprehensive list of integration statuses on the official HAQQ Network webpage, located at https://haqq.network/ecosystem. This feature underscores the network's commitment to openness and transparency, keeping users informed about ongoing developments and improvements and enabling them to make informed decisions.

## Conclusion

The incorporation of blockchain technology with Sharia law is a promising step towards creating more inclusive and diverse blockchain environments. This approach not only serves the global Muslim community but also appeals to others who appreciate ethical and sustainable financial practices.
