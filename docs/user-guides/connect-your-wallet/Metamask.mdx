# MetaMask

To interact with the HAQQ blockchain, you can use MetaMask, a popular wallet
browser extension that launched with Ethereum. Once connected to HAQQ, you can use Metamask
to manage your HAQQ accounts and interact with dApps on HAQQ.

## Connect to Mainnet

If you don't have MetaMask installed, go to the [MetaMask
website](https://metamask.io/download/) and install the extension for your
browser. Once installed, click the button below to connect your Metamask wallet
with HAQQ Mainnet using Chainlist.

<button
  onClick={() => parent.open('https://chainlist.org/chain/11235')}
  className="bg-haqq-orange mb-4 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-haqq-light-orange transition-colors duration-300 ease-in-out"
>
  Connect to Mainnnet
</button>

Chainlist helps you connect to the HAQQ Blockchain. It provides an overview of
RPC nodes that you can connect to. The purpose of RPC nodes is to allow
applications and users to communicate with a Blockchain network. RPC nodes
listen for requests, respond with the necessary data, or execute the requested
transaction.

Click `Add to Metamask` to connect to the standard provider or choose
from a list of RPC Server providers by clicking `Connect Wallet` next to the
address.

Once you've connected to an RPC Server, you're ready to go and can start using
HAQQ. If you run into any issues, you can switch your RPC endpoint, and you
should be good to go.

## Connect to Testnet

You might want to connect your wallet to the HAQQ Testnet to interact with
dApps that haven't launched on Mainnet yet. Click the button below to connect
your Metamask wallet with HAQQ Testnet using Chainlist:

<button
  onClick={() => parent.open('https://chainlist.org/chain/54211')}
  className="bg-haqq-orange mb-4 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-haqq-light-orange transition-colors duration-300 ease-in-out"
>
  Connect to Testnet
</button>

<!-- ## Connect to Local Node

You can also connect Metamask to a local node, which is useful if you are
planning on developing on HAQQ locally. If you haven't already set up your own
local node, follow the instructions in
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/haqq-network/haqq).

Open the MetaMask extension on your browser and log in to your
MetaMask account if you are not already. Then click the top right circle and go
to `Settings` > `Networks` > `Add Network` and fill the form as shown below.

![metamask networks settings](/img/metamask-network-settings.png)

Here is the list of fields that you can use to paste on Metamask:

- **Network Name:** <Highlighter keyword="name" postText=" Local" />
- **New RPC URL:** <Highlighter keyword="rpc_url"/>
- **Chain ID:** <Highlighter keyword="chain_id" />
- **Currency Symbol (optional):** <Highlighter keyword="testnet_denom" />
- **Block Explorer URL (optional):** <Highlighter keyword="block_explorer_url" /> -->

## Importing Accounts

If you own the private key to an account, you can import it to Metamask to use
the account on HAQQ. Go to `My Accounts` (top right circle) and select `Import
Account`. You should see an image like the following one:

:::note Note
If it takes some time to load the balance of the account, change the
network to <br /> <Highlighter keyword="eth_name" /> (or any other than <Highlighter keyword="rpc_url_local" /> or <Highlighter keyword="name" />)
and then switch back to <Highlighter keyword="name" />.
:::

## Download Account State

To see your Metamask logs, click the top right circle and go to `Settings` >
`Advanced` > `State Logs`. If you search through the JSON file for the account
address you'll find the transaction history.

## Reset Account

If you used your Metamask account for a legacy testnet/mainnet upgrade, you will
need to reset your account in order to use it with the new network. This will
clear your account's transaction history, but it won't change the balances in
your accounts or require you to re-enter your Secret Recovery Phrase.

:::warning
Make sure you download your <Link to="#download-account-state"><button className="text-haqq-orange hover:text-haqq-light-orange transition-colors duration-300 ease-in-out">account state</button></Link>
to persist public account addresses and transactions before clearing your wallet accounts.
:::

Go to `Settings` > `Advanced` and click the `Clear activity tab data` button as shown
below:
